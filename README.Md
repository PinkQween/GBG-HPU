üß† GBG-HPU ‚Äî A Custom CPU Built in Game Builder Garage
======================================================

Welcome to **GBG-HPU**, a custom-designed CPU architecture implemented entirely inside **Nintendo‚Äôs Game Builder Garage**! This is a passion project that explores the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible in a no-code/visual programming environment on the Nintendo Switch.

üéÆ What is This?
----------------

GBG-HPU is a fully functional, 8-bit CPU created using GBG's visual nodon system. It includes features like:

*   A register file
    
*   ALU with basic logic & arithmetic
    
*   Instruction decoding
    
*   Memory read/write operations
    
*   Clock and control logic
    
*   I/O system 
    

This project isn't just a game ‚Äî it's a hardware simulation inside a game engine!

üîç Why GBG?
-----------

Game Builder Garage isn't designed for low-level simulation, but that's exactly what makes this project interesting. Every logic gate, every clock pulse, and every memory access is handcrafted using nodons ‚Äî often pushing the engine to its limits.

üì∑ Showcase
-----------

Since GBG doesn‚Äôt allow exporting source code, the CPU is shared via:

*   Screenshots of nodon layouts
    
*   Video walkthroughs of how the CPU works
    
*   Instructions on how to download it via GBG share codes

üß± Architecture Overview
------------------------

*   **Bit Width:** 8-bit data bus
    
*   **Registers:** General-purpose registers, Program Counter, Instruction Register
    
*   **ALU Operations:** AND, OR, ADD, SUB, NOT, etc.
    
*   **Instruction Set:** Custom-designed x‚Äìx-bit opcode system
    
*   **Clock System:** Software-based cycle controller using nodons
    
*   **Memory:** ROM and RAM implemented using nodon states and logic
    

üíæ How to Load the CPU
----------------------

1.  Open **Game Builder Garage** on your Nintendo Switch.
    
2.  Go to the **Free Programming** section.
    
3.  Choose **"Receive from Online"** and enter the share code above.
    
4.  Explore the system ‚Äî you can run the CPU, inspect its logic, or modify it.
    

üß† How It Works
---------------

This CPU uses nodons as basic building blocks:

*   **Flag nodons** simulate wires or bits
    
*   **Counter nodons** for program counters and memory addressing
    
*   **Map Display** for visualizing register values or memory content
    
*   Custom instruction execution loop using timers and if/else logic
    

üõ†Ô∏è Want to Contribute?
-----------------------

Due to GBG's limitations, external collaboration is tricky, but ideas and feedback are welcome! You can:

*   Suggest optimizations for nodon layout
    
*   Help expand the instruction set
    
*   Share screenshots or adaptations of your own
